Elin Nordegren emerged for the first time since giving birth to her third child. The model, 39, and boyfriend Jordan Cameron cheered on her 10-year-old son, Charlie, at a soccer tournament in Florida on Friday, October 18. The couple brought along their newborn for the family outing. Nordegren glowed in a black, floral-print maxi dress and white sandals. She chatted with Cameron, 31, as he held their first child together. The proud mom took in the game from a chair on the sidelines. The Sweden native shares daughter Sam, 12, and son Charlie with ex-husband Tiger Woods. The pair split in 2010 following his highly publicized cheating scandal. Us Weekly reported in June that Nordegren was pregnant. She showed off her baby bump at Charlie's flag football game at the time. A source told Us in June that she and Cameron were \"very happy about the pregnancy\" and preferred to stay out of the spotlight. \"Elin maintains a low profile and has a normal, boring life,\" the insider revealed. \"Florida allows her to live that quiet life. I hear she's surprised that people care this much that she's pregnant.\" Woods, for his part, opened up about his coparenting relationship with Nordegren in October 2016. \"She's been one of my best friends and I've talked to her about so many different things and she does the same thing with me back and forth,\" the golf player, 43, said during an appearance on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. \"We communicate so much better now, it's incredible. I wish we would have done that earlier on, but it's been incredible to have a best friend like that.\" The athlete elaborated on the amicable development. \"It becomes two simple things, OK?\" he explained. \"We have Sam and we have Charlie. And we love them so much that we are going to [do] whatever it takes to make that work. That's how it happened.\" Woods admitted on Good Morning America in March 2017 that his kids \"now dominate my life and I think that's a good thing.\" Scroll to see more photos of Nordegren's post-baby outing!"}

Out-of-control fires were threatening homes near Kempsey, Tenterfield, Hillville, Nowendoc and Armidale, while two emergency-level blazes were impacting the Clarence Valley. Residents in some of the affected areas were told it was \"too late to leave\" and to protect themselves \"from the heat of the fire\" while others were ordered to evacuate immediately. Strong winds were preventing some waterbombers from reaching fires, New South Wales Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said. Hot, windy and dry conditions sparked a significant increase in dangerous fire activity across the state's east coast since Friday, November 8. Three people had died and a number were missing while hundreds of properties were damaged as a result of the fires, authorities said.

Rick Woodbury from Spokane, Washington USA, is the president, founder and sole employee of 'Commuter Cars.' The carmaker's flagship model is the 2005 super slim two-seater Tango T600, a high-performance electric car that preceded Tesla. Rick told BTV: \"I started this company 21 years ago   it was based on an idea that I came up with in 1982.\" He was inspired by the shocking traffic congestion he had to face on a daily basis. \"I used to drive a Porsche from Beverly Hills to Hermosa Beach every day and the traffic was horrendous,\" explained Rick. What really made Rick think about a solution was the fact that in most of the cars he would see in his commute were occupied by lone drivers. \"I noticed that everybody around me was a single occupant in a car, taking up the whole lane,\" Rick said. Living and working in Los Angeles also helped inspire Rick's unique creation. \"I thought, everyone wants to get from point A to point B efficiently, and in cities like Los Angeles there's really no centre, there's no hub, everybody goes everywhere,\" explained Rick. For him, there is a simple solution, and that is reducing the width that vehicles take up on the road so that 2 can fit comfortably in a single lane. \"I don't think there's any other answer except doubling lane capacity,\" said Rick. With a length of 102 inches this micro car can be parked just about anywhere, just like you would with a motorbike. Rick said: \"The length is the same width of a semi-truck so I can park perpendicular to the curb.\"The selling point of this vehicle is that it can drive in-between cars better than any other car. \"The coolest feature for me to that it can get through traffic faster than any car in history,\" said Rick. Much like a motorbike, the Tango T500 can drive right up to the stop line of traffic lights."}
